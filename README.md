A Python tool for automatically managing Reddit comments with configurable expiration policies. RTBF helps you maintain privacy and control over your digital footprint by automatically deleting or replacing your Reddit comments after a specified time period.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Comment Management**: Set comments to expire after a configurable time period
- **Flexible Strategies**: Choose to delete comments, replace with custom text, or replace with random emojis
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs continuously in the background, checking for expired comments
- **Rate Limited**: Built-in rate limiting to respect Reddit's API guidelines
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker containers
- **Configurable**: Extensive configuration options via environment variables
- **Secure**: No storage of credentials - uses environment variables only

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Reddit account with API access
- Reddit application credentials (see [Setup](#-setup))

### Installation

#### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jinglemansweep/rtbf.git
cd rtbf

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Run the application
poetry run rtbf
```

#### Using Docker

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/jinglemansweep/rtbf:latest

# Run with environment file
docker run -it --env-file .env ghcr.io/jinglemansweep/rtbf:latest
```

#### Using pip

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/jinglemansweep/rtbf.git
cd rtbf
pip install .

# Run the application
rtbf
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Strategy Options

RTBF supports three different strategies for handling expired comments:

- **delete**: Permanently removes the comment from Reddit
- **update**: Replaces the comment content with custom text
- **emoji**: Replaces the comment content with a random common emoji

### Watermark Feature

When using the "update" or "emoji" strategies, RTBF can append a watermark to replacement text to identify comments that have already been processed. This prevents the tool from repeatedly updating the same comments in future runs. Comments containing the watermark will be automatically skipped.

- **WATERMARK**: The text used to identify processed comments (default: `#rtbf`)
- **APPEND_WATERMARK**: Whether to automatically append the watermark (default: `true`)

### 1. Reddit API Setup

1. Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: Choose any name (e.g., "RTBF Comment Manager")
   - **App type**: Select "script"
   - **Description**: Optional
   - **About URL**: Optional
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080` (required but not used)
4. Note down your **Client ID** (under the app name) and **Client Secret**

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required Reddit API credentials
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_reddit_username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_reddit_password
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=RTBF/1.0 by u/your_username

# Optional configuration (with defaults)
EXPIRE_MINUTES=120                          # Comments older than 2 hours will be processed
STRATEGY=delete                             # "delete", "update", or "emoji"
REPLACEMENT_TEXT=[Comment deleted by user]  # Text to replace with if strategy=update
WATERMARK=#rtbf                             # Watermark to identify processed comments
APPEND_WATERMARK=true                       # Append watermark to replacement text
CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=10                   # Check every 10 minutes
```

    container_name: rtbf
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Docker Run

```bash
# Build locally
docker build -t rtbf .

# Run with environment file
docker run -d --name rtbf --env-file .env rtbf

# Or with individual environment variables
docker run -d --name rtbf \
  -e REDDIT_USERNAME=your_username \
  -e REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password \
  -e REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id \
  -e REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret \
  -e EXPIRE_MINUTES=120 \
  rtbf
```

## üîß Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# With Poetry

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy

- **No Data Storage**: RTBF doesn't store any of your comments or credentials
- **Local Processing**: All processing happens locally or in your controlled environment
- **Environment Variables**: Credentials are managed via environment variables
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect Reddit's API limits
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for audit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Irreversible**: Deleted comments cannot be recovered
2. **API Limits**: Reddit has rate limits - the tool includes delays to respect them
3. **New Comments**: Only processes comments older than the configured time
4. **Active Monitoring**: The tool runs continuously and requires manual stopping
